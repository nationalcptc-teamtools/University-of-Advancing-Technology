# mindSeeker
# Author: Shikata 
A Recon automation tool that simplifies the recon process for your needs by running different tools on a host based on the ports that are initially open and reporting the findings in a simplified and effective manner. 

 - MindSeeker.sh is being phased out currently. 

# Usage
```
usage: mindSeeker.py [-h] (--ipAddress IPADDRESS/CIDR | --dns DNS)
                     [--resume RESUME] [--maxThreads MAXTHREADS]

Description Placeholder

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --ipAddress IPADDRESS
                        Takes the IP Address or range of ip addresses to scan
  --dns DNS             Takes the DNS Address of the server to scan
  --resume RESUME       Used to resume a mindSeeker scan. Point it too the
                        directory where mindSeeker is stored.
  --maxThreads MAXTHREADS Adjusts the max number of threads that can run
```
 - You can only supply an ipAddress/CIDR or a DNS address. Not both
 - You can input CIDR ranges with ip addresses to scan a range of nodes. 

# Features
 - Automatically runs full scope NMAP scans on a target and outputs the results to a organized file structure
 - Prevents in-efficient scanning by only targeting found open ports with further enumeration
 - Based on certain open ports on a system. mindSeeker will try to use known tools to enumerate the common service that is usually on that.

# To Do List
 - [X] Allow for the use of CIDR notation inside IP address specifications.
 - [X] Add Threading support to the python code
 - [ ] Implement a verbose output option that allows a user to see debugged output from the program
 - [X] Convert the codebase to python
   - [X] Properly Printed and Organized Threads 
   - [X] Color Coded Output
   - [X] Perform full scope nmap scans on each target
   - [X] Properly blinking text
 - [ ] Make highlighted ports being assessed blink
 - [ ] Add the ability to use previously established file structures or files to tell if the scan had already run against a host or series of hosts. This way scans can be resumed if the are aborted mistakenly.
 - [ ] Allow comma seperated IP address lists
 - [ ] allow dashed seperated ip address ranges
   - [ ] Add a optional argument that can be used to point to a mindSeeker file structure
 - [ ] Implement options to allow the user to run passive recon tools automatically on a domain. 
 - [ ] Add the command for XML output in all nmap commands.
 - [ ] Stop blinking text after a process is complete.
 - [ ] Add support for UDP Scanning and UDP port vuln enum scanning
 - [ ] Allow the ability for processing of filtered ports
 - [ ] Ports to add specialized scanning for
 - [ ] Use Sockets for raw syn scanning instead of NMAP syn scanning to make initial evaluations faster
 - [ ] Add a thread that comes online when all other threads are used up. This thread will go ahead of the others and try to evaluate offline hosts
   - [ ] Web Services: 80, 443
     - [ ] Directory Enumeration
       - [ ] Add the ability to fuzz web directories
       - [ ] Output the results to a file 
     - [ ] Vulnerability Scanning
       - [X] Nikto
   - [ ] SQL
